# We are in beta!

JVerify is proud to announce or entrance into the beta world! With over a year of development and more than 100,000 test messages sent through the development, we are ready to begin to put our product on the market!

Here is what to expect out of your JVerify service.
- A reliable, easy-to-use API for verifying phone numbers
- A simple, not overwhelming dashboard for your API keys
- Modern, responsive, helpful, *humans* on the other side of support requests
- A privacy-focused experience. We respect the privacy of you, your customers, and your servers. We record just enough information for our service to be possible.

We strive to be an inexpensive service, so here is our pricing model:

| Volume                             | Pricing        |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------- |
| First 50 / month                   | 6¢ per message |
| Next 450 (51 - 500)  / month       | 5¢ per message |
| Next 49,500 (501 - 50,000) / month | 4¢ per message |
| > 50,001 / day                     | Contact us     |

Because we are in beta, please contact us and we will set you up with some free platform credits.
