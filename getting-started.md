## Introduction

If you have not yet familiarized yourself with JVerify, we recommend you visit our [website](https://jverify.us) first. 

We are happy you have chosen to use JVerify for your phone number verification needs. Your business is very important to us, so if you need us for anything, you can always contact us at [hello@jverify.us](mailto:hello@jverify.us).

If you need assistance implementing our solutions to your workflow, please do not hesitate to reach out to us and our development team will help you acheive your goals.

## Creating an account

JVerify uses a system of accounts for all api-related things. 

To create an account, visit [jverify.us/signup](https://jverify.us/signup) and enter your first and last name, project name, email, and password. At the bottom of the page, you will be asked to input a credit card. Even if JVerify is taking your project pro-bono or you are a student, we need a credit card for verification purposes. If you are a student or a project JVerify is taking on pro-bono (and we have confirmed that) you will not be charged.

If this is not your first account, you are still required to input a new email, password and credit card number for that project. Each project is seperately billed.

If you want new accounts to show up under the same portal when you are logged in, you need to make the **email** and **password** the same.
